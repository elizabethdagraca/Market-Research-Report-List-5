<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Quantitative PCR Kit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Probe-Based</li><li>SYBR Green</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Quantitative PCR (qPCR) kit market comprises two primary types: Probe-Based and SYBR Green. Probe-Based kits utilize specific fluorescent probes to detect and quantify DNA, offering high specificity and sensitivity, ideal for multiplex assays. In contrast, SYBR Green kits rely on a DNA-binding dye that emits fluorescence when bound to double-stranded DNA, making them simpler and more cost-effective for detecting specific DNA sequences. Both types cater to diverse applications in research, diagnostics, and biotechnology, enhancing real-time gene expression analysis.</p></p>
