<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Tire Pressure Monitoring</li><li>Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Intelligent Tires market includes two main types: **Direct Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS)** and **Indirect TPMS**. Direct TPMS uses sensors inside each tire to measure and transmit real-time pressure data to the driver, offering precise monitoring. Indirect TPMS relies on wheel speed sensors and vehicle dynamics to estimate tire pressure, making it less accurate but more cost-effective. Both systems enhance safety, fuel efficiency, and tire longevity by alerting drivers to pressure deviations.</p></p>
