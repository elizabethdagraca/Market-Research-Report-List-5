<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seawater Cooling Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The seawater cooling pump market primarily features two types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move seawater, making them efficient for high flow rates and lower viscosities, ideal for large-scale cooling applications. In contrast, positive displacement pumps move seawater by trapping a fixed amount and forcing it through the discharge, providing consistent flow under varying pressures, suitable for applications requiring precise flow control. Together, these pump types cater to diverse industrial cooling needs.</p></p>
