<p><strong>The Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Devices Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chronic Wounds</li><li>Acute Wounds</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) devices are utilized to manage both chronic and acute wounds by promoting healing through controlled negative pressure. In chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers, NPWT helps remove excess exudate, reduces bacterial load, and enhances granulation tissue formation. For acute wounds, including surgical incisions and traumatic injuries, these devices accelerate healing by improving blood flow and maintaining a moist environment. The versatility of NPWT makes it essential in modern wound care management.</p></p>
