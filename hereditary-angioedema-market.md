<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hereditary Angioedema Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>C1 Esterase Inhibitor</li><li>Kallikrein Inhibitor</li><li>Selective Bradykinin B2 Receptor Antagonist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) market consists of three main types of therapies: C1 Esterase Inhibitors, Kallikrein Inhibitors, and Selective Bradykinin B2 Receptor Antagonists. C1 Esterase Inhibitors replenish the deficient protein, preventing angioedema attacks. Kallikrein Inhibitors work by blocking the enzyme responsible for bradykinin production, which triggers swelling. Selective Bradykinin B2 Receptor Antagonists inhibit bradykinin from binding to its receptors, reducing inflammation and swelling. Together, these therapies address the distinct biochemical pathways involved in HAE, improving patient outcomes.</p></p>
