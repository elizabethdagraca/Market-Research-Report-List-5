<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lightweight Synthetic Acrylic Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning</li><li>Dry Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Lightweight Synthetic Acrylic Fibers Market comprises two primary types based on production processes: wet spinning and dry spinning. Wet spinning involves dissolving acrylic polymer in a solvent, creating a viscous solution that is extruded into a coagulation bath, forming continuous filaments. Conversely, dry spinning involves dissolving the polymer in a volatile solvent, which is then extruded into warm air to evaporate the solvent, solidifying the fibers. Both methods yield lightweight, durable acrylic fibers used in various applications, including textiles and industrial products.</p></p>
