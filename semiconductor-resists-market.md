<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Resists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Resist</li><li>Negative Resist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The semiconductor resists market is primarily divided into two types: positive resists and negative resists. Positive resists become soluble when exposed to radiation, allowing delineation of patterns upon development. They are preferred in advanced lithography processes for their fine resolution capabilities. Negative resists, in contrast, harden upon exposure, creating patterns by remaining insoluble where exposed. These resists are known for their durability and ease of handling in certain applications. Both types are crucial for semiconductor manufacturing, impacting yield and performance.</p></p>
