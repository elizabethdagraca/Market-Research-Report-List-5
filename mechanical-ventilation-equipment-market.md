<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Ventilation Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive</li><li>Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mechanical ventilation equipment market is divided into two primary types: non-invasive and invasive ventilation. Non-invasive ventilation involves the use of masks or nasal prongs to assist breathing without intubation, commonly used for patients with respiratory distress or chronic conditions. Invasive ventilation, on the other hand, requires the insertion of an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy to deliver air directly to the lungs, typically used in critical care settings for patients unable to breathe independently. Both types serve essential roles in respiratory support.</p></p>
