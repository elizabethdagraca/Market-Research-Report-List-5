<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Methanol Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>By-Product Sourced</li><li>Waste Sourced</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial methanol market is categorized into two main types based on sourcing: product-sourced and waste-sourced methanol. Product-sourced methanol is derived from traditional feedstocks like natural gas or coal, providing a stable and reliable supply. In contrast, waste-sourced methanol involves the recycling of biomass and industrial waste, which is converted into methanol through various processes. This approach promotes sustainability by reducing waste and lowering the carbon footprint associated with methanol production. Both types cater to diverse industrial applications.</p></p>
